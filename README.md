## Why?

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) plugin for asdf simplifies the installation and management of various MCP-compatible servers. It provides a uniform interface for installing, switching between, and managing different versions of MCP servers, eliminating the complexity of manual installation processes for each server type.

## Usage

```shell
# List all available MCP server types
asdf mcp list-servers

# Install a specific MCP server
asdf mcp install <server-name> <version>

# Set a specific MCP server as active
asdf mcp use <server-name> <version>

# Start an MCP server
asdf mcp start <server-name>

# Check status of running MCP servers
asdf mcp status
```

## Supported MCP Servers

This plugin currently supports the following MCP-compatible servers:

- `claude-server`: Anthropic's Claude API compatible server
- `mcp-core`: Reference implementation of the MCP protocol
- `local-llm`: For running local language models with MCP compatibility
- `custom-mcp`: For custom MCP server implementations
